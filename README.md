# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The analysis performed was used to identify correlations between the successfulness of a theater production based 
upon what month it opened during the year. An additional analysis was performed comparing the succefulness of the 
theater production based on the initial funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Overall, theater productions that are deemed successful peak in quantity during the month of May and steadily 
decline throughout the rest of the year to reach a trough in December. First glance of the failed productions 
indicates that the summer months see more failures, however the number of failures per month seems to remain relatively steady through the year. This would indicate that only the successful productions are dramatuically affected by the month 
of the year. The number of canceled productions are extremely low per month and do not show any correlation to 
launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Outcomes based on goals shows an inverse relationship between successful and failed productions that switch at around
the 50% level. Productions are most successful when their funding goal is between $0 and $9999, and 
$35,000 and $44,999

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are some conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Successful outcomes are more likely to occur during the summer months
    - It is highly unlikely that a play will be canceled regardless of what month the production was launched in
    - The probability of having a successful production is higher than having a failed production no matter what month the production is launched

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - Productions that cost $5000 or less are the most likely to be successful, while productions that cost over $45000 are the most likely to fail

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - Statistical correlation between number of successful vs. failed productions was not performed. Such analysis could prove the intuitive observations seen
    - The dataset is not distinguished by year, allowing for a "bad" year to possibly skew data
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - Bar graph comparison between successful and failed outcomes based on month and year of launch
    - Analysis comparing average donation to outcome
    - Correlation analysis between percentage funded, funding goal, and outcome
