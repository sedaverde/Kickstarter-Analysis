# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The analysis performed was used to identify correlations between the successfulness of a theater production based 
    upon what month during the year it opened. An additional analysis was performed comparing the succefulness of the 
    theater production based on the initial funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Overall, theater productions that are deemed successful peak in quantity during the month of May and steadily decline throughout the rest of the year to reach a trough in December. First glance of the failed productions indicates that te summer months see more failures, however the number of failures per month seems to hover around a monthly mean of about 41. This would indicate that only the successful productions are affected by the month of the year. The number of canceled productions are extremely low per month and do not show any correlation to launch date.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Outcomes based on goals shows an inverse relationship between successful and failed productions that switch at around the 50% level. Productions are most successful when their funding goal is bwtween less than $1000 and $9999, and $35,000 and $44,999
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
     Outcomes Based on Launch Data - Statistical correlation between number of successful vs. failed productions was not performed. Such analysis could prove the intuitive observation
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
